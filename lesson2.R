## Weâ€™ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric, integer, and

## vector?

## What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to
## check the data type of your object)

## Why do you think it happens?

## Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of the data
## types?
